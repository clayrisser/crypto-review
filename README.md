#### Pros

- the first cryptocurrency
- most trusted cryptocurrency
- cryptocurrency with the largest market cap
- leader in the cryto space

#### Cons

## Ethereum (ETH)

the first crypto currency that supports smart contracts

_1 year trend_
![](images/ethereum.png)

[ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org)

[whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper)

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)

[docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers)

#### Pros

- first crypto that support smart contracts
- most active dApp platform
- most funded crypto that supports smart contracts
- smart contract platform with the most dApps
- ethereum 2.0 has the potential to fix slow and expensive transactions and bring support for additional languages due to the EVM being replaced with WASM
- leader in the smart contract space
- largest smart contract developer community
- best development tooling in the space

#### Cons

- slow network
- expensive transaction fees (not an issue in 2.0 due to migration to PoS algorithm)
- smart contracts built in an obscure and unfamiliar custom language called solidity (theoretically not an issue in 2.0 due to transition from EVM to WASM)
- current PoW algorithm consumes massive amounts of energy (not an issue in 2.0 due to migration to PoS consensus algorithm)
- ethereum 2.0 is not ready yet

## Cardano (ADA)

largest marketcap PoS smart contract platform

_1 year trend_

[cardano.org](https://cardano.org)

[whitepaper](https://why.cardano.org/en/introduction/motivation)

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(cryptocurrency_platform))

[docs](https://docs.cardano.org)

#### Pros

- largest marketcap PoS smart contract platform
- PoS consensus allows the platform to scale efficiently
- KEVM is backwards compatible with ethereum solidity smart contracts
- IEVM supports smart contracts built in any language

#### Cons

- the crypto still needs to be proven
- there are no published dApps yet
- platform is not ready for smart contracts yet
- development community lacks a lot of resources because it is so new
